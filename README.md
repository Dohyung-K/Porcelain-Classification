# Porcelain-Classification

In this note, we try the process of implementing a CNN using Keras to classify **three kinds of porcelain** images.

Most of the code / strategy here was based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/vincee/intel-image-classification-cnn-keras) Kaggle Intel scene image classification tutorial.
